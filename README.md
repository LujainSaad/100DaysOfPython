# 100 Days Of Python

As a computer science graduate, I already have experience with Python from competitive programming contests and my graduation project. I find working on these projects enjoyable, and I'm a fan of Dr. Angela's courses <3.

## Projects

Here's a brief overview of my 100-day Python journey:

### Day 15: Setting up PyCharm 
I started by setting up the PyCharm development environment to streamline my Python projects.

### Day 16: Object-Oriented Programming (Coffee App)
I delved into the world of Object-Oriented Programming by creating a Coffee App that demonstrated key OOP principles.

### Day 17: Object-Oriented Programming (Quiz App)
Continuing with OOP, I built a Quiz App to further solidify my understanding of OOP concepts.

### Day 18: Graphics (Hirst Painting App)
I explored graphics programming by developing a Hirst Painting App that generated colorful patterns.

### Day 19: Event Listeners (Turtles Race App)
Learning about event-driven programming, I created a Turtles Race App with event listeners.

### Day 20: Animations & Coordinates (Snake Game)
An exciting milestone! I implemented animations and worked with coordinates to create a classic Snake Game.

### Day 21: Class Inheritance (Snake Game)
Building on my Snake Game, I delved into class inheritance, enhancing the game's architecture.

### Day 22: (Pong Game)
Continuing my game development journey, I started working on a Pong Game, exploring new challenges and concepts.

## Conclusion

This repository documents my progress over the course of 100 days as I dive deeper into Python, explore various programming paradigms, and create fun and engaging projects. I'm excited to continue this journey and further expand my Python skills.

Feel free to explore the individual project folders for detailed code and explanations.
